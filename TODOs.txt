Take a look:
    Typesomething wrong in al scripts cgi
        - In the configuration, try to setup the same port multiple times. It should not work.
        - Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports.
            Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.

Research:
    - Setup default error page (try to change the error 404). ?????????????????????????

More important:
    CORINA:
        - Edit cookies explanation on config file
        - manual shut down leak (check log file ./manualShutDownLeak.txt)
            CRASHED AGAIN FOR ME (i whet all over the website, including all CGI, then I went to other server and waited, then ctrl C and it leaked)
    JAKA:
        - Setup multiple servers with different hostnames (use something like: curl --resolve example.com:80:127.0.0.1 http://example.com/) BASH TEST?? (Because it is done)
        - Upload some file to the server and get it back (check if just clicking on the file/image is enough) -=
        - Download the file, --> FILE NOT FIND
        - Bonus cgi .php --> If I add a new location block called .php, the parsing of the config file stops at that location
        - if uploaded file is larger than 500kb, and if the maxbodysize is too small......
    JOYCE:
        - DONE - WHAT ABOUT listensToPort == 8008, Starting from 1024, take a look -> I THINK WE CAN LET THEM PU ANY PORT IN A RANGE OF SHORT
        CHANGE COLORS
        - Add more config files examples (mandatory by the pdf)
        - DONE - Another .php location is not working for the config file -> DONE TEST WITH BIGGER .php

Tests:
    CORINA:
    JAKA:
        - Finish tester
    JOYCE:
        Codam tester

Extras:
    CORINA:
        - Cookies as extra
    JAKA:
        - possibly adding a second cgi (php)
        - cgi - correct folder
    JOYCE:
        - DONE (Corina) - Add the set_cookies key to the location on the config file
