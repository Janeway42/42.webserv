Take a look:
    Typesomething wrong in al scripts cgi
        - In the configuration, try to setup the same port multiple times. It should not work. WHAT AREWE DOING HERE? same port on different servers is working now (but not in the same) 
        - Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports.
            Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.
        - What happens if you dont have a form on your page, but you directly write ?city=aaa in the URL?
            It serves the location by regex it seems, 200. We are returning 404 is that ok?

        - manual shut down leak (check log file ./manualShutDownLeak.txt)
            CRASHED AGAIN FOR ME (I went all over the website, including all CGI, then I went to other server and waited, then ctrl C and it leaked)
    JAKA:
        - Is it necessary at exit to set all variables to empty in destructors? -> it calls its members desructor -> check main.c
        - body chunk len ssize_t as -1? research (using the tester)
             What if method POST and content-length is zero ???
        - Finish tester
        - Does cookies expire?
    JOYCE:
        - make testr pass
        - SEARCH FOR TODO, JAKA. CORINA. JOYCE on all files
        - make config file main work on terminal
        - delete a 404 config file error after program is running

However, you are allowed to use fcntl() only as follows:
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK); ?? what exactly is GET one doing?
Any other flag is forbidden.
