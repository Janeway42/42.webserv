Take a look:
    Typesomething wrong in al scripts cgi
        - In the configuration, try to setup the same port multiple times. It should not work. WHAT AREWE DOING HERE? same port on different servers is working now (but not in the same) 
        - Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports.
            Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.
        - What happens if you dont have a form on your page, but you directly write ?city=aaa in the URL?
            It serves the location by regex it seems, 200. We are returning 404 is that ok?

More important:
    CORINA:
        - CGI is not receiving the EV_EOF for the WRITE (line 140 of webserver). php scripts are returning 500. IT NEVER GOES TO THE 141 IF
        (Corina:    The EOF from our write to the cgi gets sent the moment we close the pipe end. The EOF gets to the cgi. 
                    Can we please check what is the ret or read when we read from cgi? If it is -1 then the cgi doesn't return ok.
                    Line 141 happens only if the client closes the connection before it received the response/full response. )
        - manual shut down leak (check log file ./manualShutDownLeak.txt)
            CRASHED AGAIN FOR ME (I went all over the website, including all CGI, then I went to other server and waited, then ctrl C and it leaked)
        (Corina: where is the log? Is it still an issue?)
    JAKA:
        - Is it necessary at exit to set all variables to empty in destructors? -> it calls its members desructor -> check main.c
        - Finish tester
        - Does cookies expire?
        (Corina: Yes, cookies expire. We set the expire time in the config file. In the standard_Corina.conf i've been using for testing, the expire time is hudge for testing purposes. But it can be modified to see the expiry.)
    JOYCE:
        - make testr pass (NEED HELP)
        - SEARCH FOR TODO, JAKA. CORINA. JOYCE on all files

However, you are allowed to use fcntl() only as follows:
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK); ?? what exactly is GET one doing?
Any other flag is forbidden.
(Corina: I have written confirmation from Nicholas that I can use fcntl with F_GETFD flag. We can also use changedir and std::memset)
