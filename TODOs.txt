    Typesomething wrong in al scripts cgi
        - In the configuration, try to setup the same port multiple times. It should not work.
        - Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports.
            Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.

    JAKA:
        - Is it necessary at exit to set all variables to empty in destructors?
        - Finish tester
        - If cookie arrives, give some response in the cgi as a proof
        - DONE Download the file, --> FILE NOT FIND
    JOYCE:
