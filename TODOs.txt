Research:
    - Make a location able to accept uploaded files (it’s on the pdf). Is it saved on the root directory of the
      location? Or there is another key that we are not aware of?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More important:
    CORINA:
        - run default server - config file
        - Use max_body_size from the config file on the server
    JAKA:
        - The slash at the end of url should be always a folder, without a slash should be a file
        - Index file has to be served if it exists (even if autoindex is on)
    JOYCE:
        - Add a redirection location to the config file (and delete the port redirection)
        - Accepted HTTP methods from config file are not being used, but it’s mandatory to use
        - If the server cannot server anything from an existing location (on the config file), it serves a FORBIDDEN
          (we tested with nginx)
        - Finish connecting config data with the webserv (ex: error pages) - (I am done but don't know if we need to
          add more default pages to our server)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less important:
    CORINA:
    JAKA:
        - Standardising htmls and .py/.php?
    JOYCE:
        - Clean up config file (delete some keys)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests:
    CORINA:
        - test more with curl? (maybe already included on Jaka's tester)
        - run test script from codam - this tests for some stuff we don't need to implement!
    JAKA:
        - Maybe another stress test from somewhere else (siege)? (I think codam one is fine but if we find another one
          it would not hurt to test).
        - Finish tester
    JOYCE:
        - Add more config files examples (mandatory by the pdf)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extras:
    CORINA:
        - Cookies as extra
    JAKA:
        - possibly adding a second cgi (php)
        - cgi - correct folder
    JOYCE:
        - Add the set_cookies key to the location on the config file
        - Another .php location is not working for the config file (no error too)
