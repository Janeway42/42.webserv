Take a look:
    Typesomething wrong in al scripts cgi
        - In the configuration, try to setup the same port multiple times. It should not work.
        - Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports.
            Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.

Research:
    - Setup default error page (try to change the error 404). ?????????????????????????

    JAKA:
        - Is it necessary at exit to set all variables to empty in destructors?
        - Finish tester
        - If cookie arrives, give some response in the cgi as a proof
        - Need the name of the uploads folder (not abs path), to insert in python scripts
        - DONE Upload some file to the server and get it back (check if just clicking on the file/image is enough) -=
        - DONE Download the file, --> FILE NOT FIND
